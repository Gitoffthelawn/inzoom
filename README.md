# In Zoom 

Use mouse wheel to zoom in on images "inline" - that is - without a popup.

Hover on some image / video, press shift and use mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Once you zoom in/out on an element, this element becomes draggable, useful in case the element is partially hidden (doesn't fit in its container).

## Install

### Firefox 

The extension is listed on AMO - https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/in-zoom/

The extension **does** work fine in Chrome, but well... until it will be listed on Chrome Web Store the only way to install it is the manual one:

- Go to the chrome://extensions URL  

- Check "developer mode" 

- Click the "LOAD UNPACKED" link and point chrome to the **src** subdirectory of the unpacked archive
