# In Zoom 

Use mouse wheel to zoom in on images "inline" - that is - without a popup.

Hover on some image / video, press shift and use mouse wheel to zoom in and out.

Once you zoom in/out on an element, this element becomes draggable, useful in case the element is partially hidden (doesn't fit in its container).

## Install
